- 2 tsp lemon juice
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

_Topping_

- 1 pint heavy cream
- kiwi and/or raspberries

#### result:

One 9-10 inch cake

#### beta:

use [egg separator](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KKMMQJJ/) to get egg whites

eggs should be room temperature before beating them into meringue

only use metal or glass bowl (plastic always has fats/oils on it so it wont work)

wipe bowl with a slice of lemon

beat eggs whites by hand with a whisk (~20 min) with a mixer (~10 min) until it foamy but still not holding the shape

start adding sugar by the spoon, it needs to dissolve completely

add cornstarch, vanilla extract and lemon

whisk until "peaks formed" e.g. when you remove whisk from it, shape of peak where shisk was is holding 

preheat oven to 275 degrees fahrenheit (130 celsius), bake for 10 min, then lower oven temperature to 200 degrees fahrenheit (90 celsius), bake for 90 min. Rurn oven off let it cool in the oven (may open the door a bit).

whip heavy cream and put it on cake with kiwi slices/ raspberries. This [turntable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N2YMMIG/) makes it super easy to apply whipped cream.
